	abstract = {Levinson (1985, 1987a \& b, 1991) and Ariel (1985a \& b, 1987, 1988a \& b, 1990a, 1991) have each proposed to anchor discourse and sentential anaphora within a more general theory of communication. Levinson chose a general, extra-linguistic pragmatic theory. He uses Grice's Quantity maxim to account for the distribution of zeros, reflexives, pronouns and lexical NPs, claiming that coreferent readings are preferred, unless a disjoint reading is implicated (by the revised Gricean maxims he offers). I have proposed a specifically linguistic, cognitive theory, whereby speakers guide addressees' retrievals of mental representations corresponding to all definite NPs (coreferent as well as disjoint) by signalling to them the degree of Accessibility associated with the intended mental entity in their memory. An examination of actual data reveals that Levinson's predictions regarding definite NP interpretations are often not borne out. In addition, his proposals cannot account for many anaphoric patterns actually found in natural discourse. Accessibility theory, it is argued, can account for both types of problematic data.},

in CALL. Learner uptake is here defined as learner responses to corrective feedback in which, in case of an error, students
attempt to correct their mistake(s). 177 students from three Canadian universities participated in the study during the Spring
semester 2003. The study considered three feedback types: Meta-linguistic, Meta-linguistic + Highlighting, and Repetition +
Highlighting. Study results indicate that feedback that provides an explanation of the error and also highlights the error in the
student input (Meta-linguistic + Highlighting) is most effective at eliciting learner uptake. The study also considered two learner
variables, gender and language proficiency. Our data suggest that none of the two learner characteristics has a significant
impact on student responses to corrective feedback.},

	abstract = {Historically, in the educational field, numerous efforts have been made to facilitate the complex process of second language (L2) reading comprehension. While computers are increasingly being used for instruction for L2 reading, there is not yet a solid understanding of how this technology can be effectively used in the area of L2 reading instruction. This study examines the effect of the computer on developing L2 reading comprehension. To this end, the study reviews relevant empirical studies conducted both in L1 and L2 contexts. Although some studies reported contradictory findings, previous research has generally supported the notion that computer-assisted reading programs facilitate L2 reading comprehension. Several advantages of using the computer for enhancing reading  comprehension have been identified, for example, facilitating automatic word recognition and vocabulary acquisition, providing multimedia glossing, strengthening the benefits of reading strategy training, and stimulating student motivation toward reading. The literature review also points out the need for reading software incorporating sound theoretical principles of the reading process. Reflecting the need, this study establishes practical guidelines for designing and evaluating reading software on the basis of interactive processing theory, which is currently one of the most prevalent reading theories.

	abstract = {This dissertation investigated the acquisition and processing of anaphora by learners of English, using both "offline" methods such as paper-and-pencil written tests and "online" methods such as self-paced reading-for-comprehension. Three experiments were conducted. The first two experiments tested advanced Chinese ESL learners' knowledge and processing of anaphora. The focus of the first experiment was on whether participants automatically use gender and number cues, and verb information to interpret pronouns and reflexives during online processing. The second experiment manipulated gender and pragmatic cues to test whether participants have acquired knowledge of structural constraints on reflexive interpretation (i.e., the binding principles). The third experiment, using a pretest-treatment-posttest design, investigated the efficacy of computer-delivered Processing Instruction (PI) on the acquisition of structural constraints and the use of those constraints during reading. During the pretest, subjects completed a self-paced reading task and a written test. For the treatment, participants learned the grammatical constraints on reflexives through interaction with a computer program. Posttest assessment included one interpretation test, one sentence completion task, and one self-paced reading task. The role of feedback in Computer Assisted Language Learning was also examined. Results showed the following: (1) Advanced L2 learners were more sensitive to certain types of agreement information (gender) than others (number). (2) PI improved L2 learners' knowledge about constraints on reflexives as measured by offline tests. (3) PI led to improvement in learners' processing strategies as measured by online tasks. (4) No significant difference was found between the implicit feedback group and the explicit feedback group in the third experiment. Overall, this research highlights the importance of multiple types of assessment that tap the acquisition of grammatical knowledge as well as the proficiency with which learners use that knowledge during reading comprehension tasks.},

were analyzed using a model developed for the study and comprising the various moves in an
error treatment sequence. Results include the frequency and distribution of the six different
feedback types used by the four teachers, in addition to the frequency and distribution of different
types of learner uptake following each feedback type. The findings indicate an overwhelming
tendency for teachers to use recasts in spite of the latter's ineffectiveness at eliciting
student-generated repair. Four other feedback types—elicitation, metalinguistic feedback,
clarification requests, and repetition—lead to student-generated repair more successfully
and are thus able to initiate what the authors characterize as the negotiation of form.},

	abstract = {After explaining why consideration of the use of technology in second language (L2) teaching in the primary and secondary sectors is necessary, this systematic review presents a keyword map of 117 studies of technology in L2 learning since 1990. It reveals that research effort in these educational sectors has increased in line with technological developments and there have been important differences between the primary and secondary sectors in the adoption of applications. There then follows an in-depth review of 47 post-2000 studies investigating the efficacy of technology in the teaching of L2 English. It asks what technology has been used and why, what evidence there is that technology facilitates language learning, and what other insights can be drawn from the research in this field. The evidence that technology has a direct beneficial impact on linguistic outcomes is slight and inconclusive, but it may impact indirectly and positively on learner attitudes and behaviours and may promote collaboration. On the whole, the research reviewed lacked the quality that would reassure practitioners and policy-makers that technological investment is warranted. We argue that future research needs to provide a tighter link between technological applications, Second Language Acquisition (SLA) theory, and learning outcomes.},

The motivation scales tap into three broad areas: (1) value (intrinsic and extrinsic goal orientation, task value), (2) expectancy (control beliefs about learning, self-efficacy); and (3) affect (test anxiety). The learning strategies section is comprised of nine scales which can be distinguished as cognitive, metacognitive, and resource management strategies. The cognitive strategies scales include (a) rehearsal, (b) elaboration, (c) organization, and (d) critical thinking. Metacognitive strategies are assessed by one large scale that includes planning, monitoring, and regulating strategies. Resource management strategies include (a) managing time and study environment; (b) effort management, (c) peer learning, and (d) help-seeking. Scale reliabilities are robust, and confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated good factor structure. In addition, the instrument shows reasonable predictive validity to the actual course performance of students.},

	abstract = {To succeed at a university, students need to read expository texts effectively and meaningfully to access and understand information, and internalize it for study purposes. An important component of the comprehension process is the reader's ability to integrate current information with information mentioned earlier in a text. One aspect of this integration process involves anaphoric resolution. This paper reports on findings from a study that investigated anaphoric resolution by first-year English as a second language students during the reading of expository texts. The relationship between skill in anaphoric resolution, academic performance, and language proficiency was examined. Linguistic and textual factors such as type and inference strength of anaphoric tie were also taken into account to examine differential resolution effects. The findings showed that students who were not performing well academically were not skilled at resolving anaphors. Anaphoric resolution was also affected by linguistic and textual differences. Differences in anaphoric resolution diminished as proficiency in English increased. Anaphoric resolution was also affected by the strength of the anaphoric tie; successful anaphoric resolution dropped when the anaphoric tie required greater inferential processing. This was particularly evident among the academically weaker students. The findings suggest that anaphoric resolution in expository texts plays an important role in reading to learn. The implications of these findings are briefly discussed for English as a second language students.},

	abstract = {Online learning environments are more prevalent in teacher education than ever before. In 2009, many instructors are attempting to emulate traditional instructional methods in the online learning environment as much as possible. Online courses are separated into two categories, (1) asynchronous; and (2) synchronous, depending on the nature of the online tool. Asynchronous courses provide learners with a flexible environment that is self-paced with learners accessing course content using a variety of tools such as CD-ROMs, streamed prerecorded audio/video web recordings, and audio podcasts. On the other hand, synchronous courses provide online learning environments that are very interactive and use web conferencing products such as "Elluminate Live, Interwise, Wimba Live Classroom, Adobe Acrobat Connect Professional," and "Saba Centra". This study aims to compare asynchronous online environments and synchronous web conferencing environments and their effect on the achievement and satisfaction of students. Specifically, the study investigates whether asynchronous and synchronous online instruction result in differences in student performance, student satisfaction, or student perception of their technology skills. Forty-four preservice general education and special education students receive instruction in two different types of online learning environments (asynchronous text-based lectures using WebCT and synchronous web conferencing lectures using "Elluminate Live"). The results of this analysis suggest that both types of lectures are effective in delivering online instruction. In addition, almost three-fourths (30 of the 41 students) of the students indicate that they would rather take an online course that uses synchronous web conferencing lectures than an online asynchronous text-based lecture course. This finding suggests the importance of interactivity on student satisfaction in a course. This study supports the finding that students participating in an online course perceive an increased level of their technology skills. (Contains 2 figures and 4 tables.)},

	abstract = {The present study investigates discourse functions and syntactic complexity in English-as-asecond-language (ESL) learner output obtained via two different modes of computer-mediated communication (CMC): asynchronous and synchronous discussions. Two instructors and twentyfive students from two advanced ESL writing classes participated in this study. Answers were sought to the following questions: a) Are the discourse functions present in ESL learners' synchronous discussions of reading assignments quantitatively and qualitatively different from those found in asynchronous discussions? And, b) which mode of CMC shows more syntactically complex learner output? The results showed that the quantity and types of discourse functions present in synchronous discussions were similar to the types of interactional modifications found in face-to-face conversations that are deemed necessary for second language acquisition. Discourse functions in asynchronous discussions were more constrained than those found in synchronous discussions and similar to the question-response-evaluation sequence of the traditional language classroom. Concerning syntactic complexity, the delayed nature of asynchronous discussions gives learners more opportunities to produce syntactically complex language. Asynchronous and synchronous CMC have different discourse features which may be exploited for different pedagogical purposes. In the hands of experienced teachers, both modes of CMC can be used as novel tools to enhance the language acquisition process by encouraging interaction among participants, collaborative text construction, and the formation of electronic communities of learners.},
